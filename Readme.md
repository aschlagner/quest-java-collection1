SEA8 - Quest: Collection 01: List

Challenge: Infinity War

Thanos has decided to program his infinity gauntlet to create a ranked list of Heroes, with the final goal of randomly eliminating half of them.

To start, fork this repository, then clone it locally.

Don't forget to Fork, otherwise you won't be able to push anything!

Initialise an ArrayList named heroes which will contain multiple Hero instances.

Add the following new instances of Hero to the heroes list:

// name: Black Widow, age: 34  
// name: Captain America, age: 100  
// name: Vision, age: 3  
// name: Iron Man, age: 48  
// name: Scarlet Witch, age: 29  
// name: Thor, age: 1500
// name: Hulk, age: 49  
// name: Doctor Strange, age: 42

It's Thor's birthday, he's now 1501 years old! Modify his instance in the list accordingly.

Mix up the list randomly using an existing method (this is covered in a resource from a previous step in this quest).

Keep only the top half of the list using an existing method (also covered in a resource from a previous step).

Using a loop, display the names of the heroes that are still standing in the terminal.
